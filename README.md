## About Me  
>Hello! Iâ€™m Viktor Stoimenov, a versatile web developer with a strong background in front-end development and a growing interest in back-end systems. I thrive in team settings and am always eager to learn new skills and technologies to keep improving myself!

## Work Experience

### Endava
In their intensive internship, I was responsible for designing and developing the front-end of a complex single-page web application in a team with other interns using React.

I also implemented authentication, authorization, state management as well as asynchronous API handling and more.

### DiaDraw
Here I had the pleasure of working on the back-end of a web application while working in a team, where I built a secure authentication and authorization system as well as a documented REST API using NodeJs and Express along with using SQL as the database.

Furthermore, I worked on the UI with React but not as extensively.

## Projects

### Wedding Site
A simple, pretty, and functional wedding site I made for my sister. It uses a REST API to write the form applications to an easy-to-use excel sheet.

### Portfolio Website
A simple portfolio website I made using React and Spline, mainly to be a checkpoint for me to update my skills/experience. I also had some fun with the less standard design.
